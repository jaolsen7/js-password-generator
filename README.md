# js-password-generator

## Description
This project functions by prompting the user to decide a password length, then asks if they want lowercase, uppercase, or special characters, and finally produces a random password based on the accepted criteria.

This project was very challenging at first, but after breaking it down and reaching out for help, I was able to complete it! I'm very proud of my work.

## Credits
I would like to thank my classmates that attended the study group, my professor for helping with the pseudocode/initial coding, and my tutor for helping me finalize my project by pointing out the little things I missed.
